#Common Observations
#High Quality Maintained: Post-trimming Q30 rates improved across all samples, reaching above 92.7%, which is excellent.

#Low Adapter Contamination: Only one sample (KO_SRR13633858) had detectable adapter sequences.

#Low Discard Rates: Reads lost due to low quality or being too short were minimal (~2–3% total).

#Duplication Rates: Ranged from 56.8% to 60.9%. This is relatively high, likely due to single-end sequencing and possibly high sequencing depth or low-complexity libraries.
