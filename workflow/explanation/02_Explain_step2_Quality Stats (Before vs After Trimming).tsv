#Common Observations
#High Quality Maintained: Post-trimming Q30 rates improved across all samples, reaching above 92.7%, which is excellent.

#Low Adapter Contamination: Only one sample (KO_SRR13633858) had detectable adapter sequences.

#Low Discard Rates: Reads lost due to low quality or being too short were minimal (~2–3% total).

#Duplication Rates: Ranged from 56.8% to 60.9%. This is relatively high, likely due to single-end sequencing and possibly high sequencing depth or low-complexity libraries.

## Common Observations

✨ **High Quality Maintained**  
After trimming, **Q30 rates improved in all samples**, surpassing **92.7%**, which indicates excellent base quality.

🧬 **Low Adapter Contamination**  
Only **KO_SRR13633858** showed detectable adapter trimming.

📉 **Minimal Loss**  
Only ~2–3% of reads were discarded for low quality or being too short.

🔁 **Duplication Rates**  
Duplication ranged from **56.8% to 60.9%** — somewhat high, likely owing to single-end sequencing or limited library complexity.
