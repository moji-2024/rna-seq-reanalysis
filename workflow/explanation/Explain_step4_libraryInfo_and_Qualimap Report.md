<h1>1. Understanding the Qualimap Report</h1>

<h2>Reads Alignment (Table)</h2> 

- Mapped reads (26.8M): These are reads that aligned to the genome. This is a healthy number. This is wnat we want.

- Secondary alignments (5.5M): Reads that align in more than one place. Expected in RNA-seq.

- Not aligned (452k): Very small fraction. That‚Äôs good.

- Strand specificity (0.51/0.49): Confirms your data is non-stranded.

<h2>Reads Genomic Origin </h2>

<h3>1. Exonic reads (‚âà90% in sample KO_SRR13633857)</h3>

These fall inside annotated **exons** ‚Äî the protein-coding or mature transcript parts of genes.

Typical RNA types here:

- **mRNA** (messenger RNA) ‚Üí the main product of RNA-seq, spliced and coding.

- **lncRNA exons** (long noncoding RNA) ‚Üí also transcribed but not coding proteins.

- **miRNA precursors**, **snoRNAs**, **snRNAs** that are annotated as exon-like regions.

- Basically, **any RNA that makes it into the ‚Äúfinal transcript‚Äù after splicing**.

üëâ In RNA-seq, a **high exonic fraction is good** because it means you captured mature transcripts, not random noise.

<h3>2. Intronic reads (‚âà6% in sample KO_SRR13633857)</h3>

These are inside introns, the parts usually cut out during splicing.
Possible explanations:

- **Unspliced pre-mRNA** ‚Üí immature transcripts still being processed in the nucleus.

- **Retained introns** ‚Üí some alternative splicing events keep introns in mature RNA.

- **Nascent transcription** ‚Üí reads caught while RNA polymerase was still working.

- **Noncoding RNAs** ‚Üí some lncRNAs and regulatory RNAs overlap intronic regions.

- **Technical artifact** ‚Üí incomplete removal of nuclear RNA during library prep.

üëâ Some intronic signal is normal (often 5‚Äì15%). Very high intronic reads (>30‚Äì40%) may mean poor poly(A) selection or contamination with nuclear RNA.

<h3>3. Intergenic reads (‚âà4.5% in sample KO_SRR13633857)</h3>

These fall **outside annotated genes**.
What could they be?

- **Unannotated transcripts** ‚Üí novel lncRNAs, enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).

- **Antisense RNAs** ‚Üí transcribed from opposite strands of genes.

- **Pseudogenes** or lowly annotated gene fragments.

- **Noise/technical artifacts** ‚Üí random priming, misalignment, or sequencing errors.

üëâ A small fraction of intergenic reads is expected. If it‚Äôs very high (>20‚Äì30%), it could indicate problems with annotation (using an incomplete GTF) or contamination.

<h2>Coverage Profile Along Genes (3 plots: Total, Low, High expression genes)</h2> 
<h3>Terminology alert!</h3>

**1. What is coverage in RNA-seq?**
- Coverage = how many sequencing reads overlap a given position in the transcripts.
- Imagine a transcript (gene) as a rope stretched from 5‚Ä≤ end ‚Üí 3‚Ä≤ end.

- If you have lots of sequencing reads all along the genome, you have good coverage.
- If most of the sequencing reads is stuck only at one end, that‚Äôs biased coverage.

**Note**: the 3‚Ä≤ end is more likely to have bias in typical RNA-seq datasets.

**2. What is 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ bias?**
- **3‚Ä≤ bias**: Many RNA-seq protocols use poly(A) selection with oligo-dT primers, which grab transcripts starting at the poly(A) tail (3‚Ä≤ end). That naturally enriches reads near the 3‚Ä≤ end, giving you 3‚Ä≤ bias.
- **5‚Ä≤ bias**: 5‚Ä≤ bias does happen, but usually less often. It can show up if:
  - Reverse transcriptase stops early (so you only sequence the start of transcripts).
  - Fragmentation favors the 5‚Ä≤ region.
  
This data(KO_SRR13633857) has below bias=
-  5‚Ä≤ bias = 0.84,
-  3‚Ä≤ bias = 0.67,
-  5‚Ä≤‚Äì3‚Ä≤ ratio = 1.27

<h3>How do Qualimap create Coverage Profile Along Genes plots:</h3>

- Each plot is a line graph of read density across transcripts, from the 5‚Ä≤ end (start of the gene) on the left, to the 3‚Ä≤ end (end of the gene) on the right.
  Qualimap squash all genes together, normalize them to the same length, and then average coverage across them.

<h3>What are each axis in Coverage Profile Along Genes</h3>

- *X-axis* = transcript position (0‚Äì100%)
  0% (left side) ‚Üí the Transcription Start Site (TSS), the beginning of the mRNA (the 5‚Ä≤ end).
  100% (right side) ‚Üí the Transcription Termination Site (TTS), the end of the mRNA (the 3‚Ä≤ end).
- *Y-axis* = average read coverage at that position (normalized).
 
<h3>Each Coverage Profile Along Genes plot</h3>

- 1) **Total (all genes combined):**

  This averages coverage across all genes.
  It gives you a global sense of bias.
  In your data, coverage is slightly higher at the 5‚Ä≤ end and drops a bit toward the 3‚Ä≤ end.

- 2) **Low expression genes:**

  Shows coverage distribution only for genes with low read counts.
  These often look noisier and less uniform, because there aren‚Äôt many reads to smooth the curve.
  If low-expression genes show extreme bias, it might mean short transcripts or uneven capture in weakly expressed genes.

</p>

---

- 3) **High expression genes:**

  Shows coverage across highly expressed transcripts only.
  These curves are usually smoother, since there are many reads.
  If there‚Äôs a strong 5‚Ä≤ or 3‚Ä≤ skew here, it reflects a true systematic bias from library prep rather than random noise.

<h2>Coverage Histogram (0‚Äì50X)</h2> 

  -  It shows at how many places in the transcriptome do we see 1 read, 2 reads, 10 reads, 20 reads‚Ä¶?
  -  X-axis = coverage depth (how many reads overlap each base in a transcript)
  -  Y-axis = number of bases (or fraction of the transcriptome) that have that coverage

  Good RNA-seq should have many transcripts covered at useful depth.
  
  **This tells downstream tools (like DESeq2/edgeR) that you have enough coverage to detect expression.**

<h2>Junction Analysis</h2> 

**When RNA is transcribed, introns get spliced out, and exons are stitched together.**
  
-  A junction read is a sequencing read that spans across an exon‚Äìexon boundary.
-  The Junction Analysis graph counts these reads and classifies them by the splice motifs they use (the bases at the splice donor and acceptor sites).

**What do the motifs mean?**

Splice sites are defined by short sequence patterns at the boundaries of introns:
-  Most common in humans:
   -  GT‚ÄìAG rule: introns usually begin with GT and end with AG.
   -  So, an exon‚Äìintron boundary will look like ‚ÄúAG|GT‚Äù when you align exons and introns together.
-  Less common motifs also exist (like GC‚ÄìAG or AT‚ÄìAC), and noncanonical sites are rare but real.
In this report, the graph shows percentages of different motifs:
-  ACCT, AGGT, AGGA, etc. ‚Üí these are the sequence signatures observed at the junctions your reads covered.
-  Reads at junctions: 5.5M ‚Üí plenty of reads spanning exon-exon boundaries, confirming splicing was captured.
-  Shows percentages of canonical splice motifs (AGGT is common in human).

<h1>2. Is this Data Good or Bad?</h1> 

‚úÖ Good signs in this data:
  High exonic reads (89.5%) ‚Üí strong signal from transcripts.
  Very low rRNA contamination.
  Balanced strand specificity (expected for non-stranded).
  Junction reads are present in large numbers ‚Üí good splice representation.
  Only 1.3% of reads failed to align ‚Üí excellent mapping.

‚ö†Ô∏è Minor caveats:
  Slight 5‚Ä≤ coverage bias. This is normal for RNA-seq, not fatal.
  Around 10% of reads fell in intronic/intergenic regions ‚Üí expected, but can be trimmed down with stricter filtering.
Overall: Your RNA-seq data is high quality and perfectly usable for downstream analysis.

3. Next Steps
  1.Generate count matrix:
    By "Salmon" to get a gene-by-sample counts table.
  2.Normalization:
    Apply DESeq2 (R) to account for sequencing depth and library size.
  3.Differential Expression Analysis:
    Compare KO vs WT or conditions of interest. Find up- and down-regulated genes.
  4.Exploratory Analysis:
    PCA/Clustering ‚Üí see if samples group by condition.
    Heatmaps ‚Üí visualize top DE genes.
  5.Functional Analysis
  Pathway enrichment (KEGG, GSEA, Reactome) to interpret biological meaning.


*This RNA-seq dataset passed QC with ~90% exonic reads, strong mapping rates, and minimal contamination. Coverage is balanced across transcripts, with only a mild 5‚Ä≤ bias typical of RNA-seq. Junction reads confirm splicing capture. Overall, the dataset is high-quality and ready for downstream differential expression and functional analysis.
